## My process

I had some difficulties but managed to solve, in parts, the proposed challenge. I'm still in the beginning stage in html, css and javascript

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS properties
- Mobile first workflow

### What I've learned

I learned that, in addition to being patient, some forms of code can be put in a more organized way, especially in CSS, making the code simpler and more practical to understand.

### Ongoing development

I'm focused on continuing to learn and practice HTML, CSS and Javascript. I'm also interested in Python and PHP and will start studying them soon.

### Useful Resources

- [Centering of divs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/portuguese/news/como-centralizar-tudo-com-css/#:~:text=Para%20centralizar%20texto%20ou%20links%20na%20horizontal%2C%20simplesmente,%28centered%29%20World%21%3C%2Fp%3E%20%3C%2Fdiv%3E%20p%20%7B%20text-align%3A%20center%3B%20%7D) - This helped me understand the centering of a div. I really like this pattern and will be using it going forward.
